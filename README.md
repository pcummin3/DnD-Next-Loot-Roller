# DnD-Next-Loot-Roller
A personal C++ project I worked on over the summer of 2015.  This program is my take on the DnD Next loot tables with dice rolling and output implemented.  I also added a few other optional items a DM can reward players with (cursed items and magical gems from the "Diablo" Universe, Blizzard Entertainment Trademarked).
